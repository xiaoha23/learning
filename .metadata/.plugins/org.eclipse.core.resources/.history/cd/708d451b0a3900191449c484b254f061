Code in OOP
*Everything is an object
*All code blocks are "associated" with classes and objects

public void greet(action) {
		action();
	}
	
function as values(inline values)

aBlockOfCode = public void perform() {
					System.out.print("Hello World!");
					}

when the function was passed as an inline value, there is no need to specify access modifier(public),
return type(compiler will figure that out) and function name(not being referenced anywhere else)
aBlockOfCode = () -> {
					System.out.print("Hello World!");
					}

if there is only 1 line in lambda expression, curly braces are not needed.
